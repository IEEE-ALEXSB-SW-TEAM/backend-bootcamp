# IEEE AlexSB Backend Boot Camp 2024
Hello, my friends! This repository serves as a summary for our backend boot camp at IEEE AlexSB. We organized this camp with the aim of sharing knowledge and providing hands-on experience with the MERN stack. The MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB (M), Express.js (E), React.js (R), and Node.js (N), is utilized for building full-stack websites.

We strongly believe that alongside the scientific knowledge acquired in college, students should also possess technological skills. Thus, we are committed to bridging this gap through our boot camps.

## Camp Workflow

The camp spanned over 4 days, each focusing on different aspects of web development with the MERN stack.

### Day 1: JavaScript & Node.js Basics
On the first day, we quickly revised JavaScript syntax and basics, emphasizing its importance as the backbone of Node.js and Express.js.

Content for Day 1 can be found [here](./Day1-JSandnodeJS/).

### Day 2: Express.js Basics
Day 2 was dedicated to learning the fundamentals of Express.js. Together, we delved into basic web development concepts and learned how to build a server using Express.js and Node.js.

### Day 3: Databases & MongoDB
The focus of the third day was on databases, where we covered key concepts and applied them using MongoDB.

### Day 4: Hands-on Project
The final day was dedicated to a hands-on project, where participants applied their learnings to build a project which is a simple personal blog.
