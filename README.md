# IEEE AlexSB Backend Boot Camp 2024
Hello, my friends! This repository serves as a summary for our backend boot camp at IEEE AlexSB. We organized this camp with the aim of sharing knowledge and providing hands-on experience with the MERN stack. The MERN stack, which stands for MongoDB (M), Express.js (E), React.js (R), and Node.js (N), is utilized for building full-stack websites.

We strongly believe that alongside the scientific knowledge acquired in college, students should also possess technological skills. Thus, we are committed to bridging this gap through our boot camps.
